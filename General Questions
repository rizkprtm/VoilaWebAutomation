Answers : 
1. For specific reason my passion is to do the activity to the fullest it means I always give my 100% for what I working on, especially in the Software Development processes.
   I want to be better everyday whether is just reading one sentence of new knowledge each day and keep improving my skills to bear the responsibility as a human being.

2. Because I want to ensure the quality of things that I joined in, I do have an experience with bad products as a user and its sucks. Bad experience on products/application makes the user
   did not use the application anymore even the application has some value or ease the activity for people, so then I want to make sure that the product is good and run smoothly then our work as team not going to waste.

3. My goal is to become Full Stack QA Engineer/ Full Stack SDET and maintain the useful of human interaction with the application so it cannot be replaced by AI.

4. As I said in the first point, growth process to my goal is by doing/reading as small as one sentence or the meaning of the word and gain new knowledge each day. So that QA Engineer will learn unique way and keep up with the moving technology in years ahead.

5. My expectation to joining the Catalyst is to collaborate with amazing people that I see on the company page and giving my value or effort to strengthen the team, for the furthest expectation maybe I could grow my career in Catalyst and to manage the team if I was ready as a team leader.

THANKS!
